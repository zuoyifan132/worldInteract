# Task Construction Module

**Status: Future Implementation**

This module will implement the task construction system described in the AgentScaler paper for generating agentic training tasks.

## Planned Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Agentic Task Construction**
- Generate realistic user intents
- Create tool sequences for task completion
- Simulate human-agent interactions

### ðŸ¤– **Human-Agent Interplay**
- Simulated user behavior
- Multi-turn conversation generation
- Goal-oriented task completion

### ðŸ“Š **Experience Collection**
- Trajectory filtering and validation
- Quality control mechanisms
- Training data preparation

### ðŸ”„ **Two-Stage Learning Pipeline**
- General domain capability training
- Domain-specific specialization

## Architecture (Planned)

```
Environment â†’ Task Generator â†’ Simulated Interplay â†’ Experience Collection â†’ Training Data
```

### Components (Future)

1. **TaskGenerator**: Create tasks from environment state
2. **SimulatedUser**: Generate realistic user behavior
3. **InterplayManager**: Orchestrate human-agent conversations
4. **ExperienceCollector**: Filter and validate trajectories
5. **TrainingDataPreparer**: Format data for model training

## Integration Points

- **Environment Manager**: Use generated environments for task creation
- **Tool Systems**: Leverage validated tools for task execution
- **Model Manager**: Use LLMs for simulation and generation

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Task Generation
- [ ] Simple task template system
- [ ] Basic user intent generation
- [ ] Tool sequence planning

### Phase 2: Interplay Simulation
- [ ] Simulated user implementation
- [ ] Multi-turn conversation handling
- [ ] Goal completion detection

### Phase 3: Experience Pipeline
- [ ] Trajectory filtering framework
- [ ] Quality validation system
- [ ] Training data formatting

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Domain-specific task patterns
- [ ] Complex multi-tool scenarios
- [ ] Failure recovery simulation

## Future Usage (Planned)

```python
from worldInteract.tasks import TaskGenerator, InterplayManager

# Generate tasks from environment
task_gen = TaskGenerator()
tasks = task_gen.generate_tasks(environment, num_tasks=100)

# Simulate human-agent interplay
interplay = InterplayManager()
trajectories = interplay.simulate_interactions(tasks, agent_model)

# Collect experience for training
experience = interplay.collect_experience(trajectories)
```

## Configuration (Planned)

```yaml
task_generation:
  max_turns: 10
  complexity_levels: ["simple", "medium", "complex"]
  success_rate_threshold: 0.8

interplay_simulation:
  user_model: "simulated_user_v1"
  max_conversation_length: 20
  failure_simulation: true

experience_collection:
  filtering_strictness: "high"
  min_trajectory_length: 3
  max_trajectory_length: 50
```
